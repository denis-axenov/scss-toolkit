# SCSS Toolkit

**SCSS Toolkit** is a modern library that offers a collection of ready-to-use mixins and functions designed to solve common CSS challenges with a single call. The toolkit is built to leverage the power of the `@use` directive, moving away from the deprecated `@import` approach, ensuring better modularity, code isolation, and avoiding naming conflicts.

## Key Features

- **Mixins**: Simplify common tasks such as element alignment, spacing management, media queries, grid layouts, and more with straightforward mixin calls.

- **Functions**: Includes utilities for color manipulation, size calculations, value transformations, and other helpful tools.

- **Easy Integration**: Fast setup using the `@use` directive, minimizing code duplication and providing clear namespaces.

- **Modular Structure**: Mixins and functions can be imported as needed, allowing you to include only what your project requires.

SCSS Toolkit streamlines the writing of styles, reducing code complexity and enhancing readability. It's suitable for projects of all sizes, from small websites to large-scale web applications.
